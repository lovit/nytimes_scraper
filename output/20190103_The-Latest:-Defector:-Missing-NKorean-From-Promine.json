His whereabouts are not publicly known now.\n___\n10:55 a.m.\nThe Italian Foreign Ministry says the envoy who had been North Korea's acting ambassador in Rome has not asked Italian authorities for asylum.\nSouth Korea's spy agency told lawmakers in Seoul on Thursday that North Korean diplomat Jo Song Gil went into hiding with his wife in November before his term in Italy ended. His whereabouts are not publicly known now.\nItaly on Thursday noted that it had been notified in the past that Jo's spell as a diplomat in Italy had ended and thus he no longer held any diplomatic position in Italy.\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the diplomat might have sought asylum from another country's embassy or consulate in Italy.\nMinistry officials spoke to The Associated Press under their customary rules of anonymity on delicate matters.\n— By Frances D'Emilio in Rome.\n___\n9 a.m.\nSouth Korea says North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil, went into hiding with his wife in November.\nSouth Korea's spy agency told the information to lawmakers in Seoul on Thursday.\nA high-profile defection by one of North Korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong Un as he pursues diplomacy with Seoul and Washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.\nSouth Korean lawmaker Kim Min-ki said an official from Seoul's National Intelligence Service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. Kim said the NIS said it has not been contacted by Jo.\nNorth Korea has not yet commented on Jo's status.\nAbout 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War."
