The new year is absolutely frigid across much of North America.\nA jet stream is shuttling arctic air from northwestern Canada to the eastern U.S., sending temperatures plummeting to record lows and creating dangerous conditions. Above, Niagara Falls.\nForecasters say it will continue at least into the weekend. So bundle up, or stay in if you can. A couple of links that might come in handy: Cooking’s guide to making soup, and our list of the 100 best movies on Netflix.\n_____\n2. Iran’s supreme leader blamed the country’s “enemies” for the wave of deadly protests that have gripped the nation since last week.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of the protesters, did not identify those foes, but said he would “speak to the dear people when the time is right.” At least 21 people have died in the protests and clashes with security forces, and hundreds have been arrested.\nPresident Trump reiterated his support for the protesters, and the U.S. urged Iran not to restrict access to social media, which demonstrators are using to publicize protests.\n_____\n3. The Olympics may bring North and South Korea together.\nSouth Korea is hosting the Winter Games next month, and the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, offered to send a delegation of athletes in his New Year’s speech. Above, a countdown clock in Seoul.\nTalks between the two countries could take place as soon as next week. Analysts say Mr. Kim may be trying to drive a wedge between the South and the U.S.\n_____\n4. News from Washington:\nOrrin Hatch, above right, the longest-serving G.O.P. senator and one of President Trump’s strongest allies, plans to retire. His exit leaves an opening in Utah for Mitt Romney, a top Trump critic.\nThe president tweeted about “Crooked Hillary” less than 48 hours into the new year, accusing Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin of “disregarding basic security protocols,” and calling his own Justice Department a “deep state.”\nAnd on “The Daily,” we discuss how a night of heavy drinking by a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, set off the federal inquiry into Russian election meddling.\n_____\n5. One of America’s biggest rehab companies built an empire. But after a patient died, its enemies — investors and business rivals alike — struck hard. Above, Charles Hill, a rival and longtime critic of the company.\nWe’ve been investigating the booming but haphazardly regulated industry of addiction treatment. Read the other articles in the series here.\n_____\n6. Today in fallout from sexual harassment and abuse scandals:\nHoda Kotb, left, a longtime NBC News correspondent, will permanently replace the ousted “Today” co-anchor Matt Lauer. She had been filling in since he was fired for inappropriate sexual behavior in November.\nPeter Martins, who led the New York City Ballet for decades, stepped down while rejecting accusations of harassment and abuse. Our dance critic asks whether his departure creates an opening to reform ballet.\nAnd our food critic says that revelations are playing out “excruciatingly slowly,” if at all, in the restaurant world.\n_____\n7. Dave Chappelle released the first comedy special focusing on the #MeToo movement, and our critic says it was a misfire, with bits that feel tired or callous. One example: Mr. Chappelle said that some of the sexual assault victims speaking out were now experiencing “buyer’s remorse.”\nBut Mr. Chappelle also offers sober political analysis during the show, which is streaming on Netflix. And he makes a passionate argument for focusing on structural issues.\n“You got all the bad guys scared, and that’s good,” he says. “But the minute they’re not scared anymore, it will get worse than it was before. Fear does not make lasting peace.”\n_____\n8. Our DealBook columnist looks at 2017’s biggest deals and biggest winners.\nAbove, Rupert Murdoch, who agreed to sell much of 21st Century Fox to Disney last month, in one of the biggest business stories of the year.\nAnd the DealBook team weighed in on what business stories will dominate the headlines for the next 12 months, from trade fights to Uber to North Korea.\n_____\n9. A note from our new publisher.\nAddressing readers of The Times, A. G. Sulzberger explains his approach to the job in “a period of profound challenge,” when “misinformation is rising and trust in the media is declining.” Read his comments here.\nThe 37-year-old took the reins from his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., last month. He’ll be answering readers’ questions, and you can submit yours here. Above, our headquarters in Manhattan.\n_____\n10. Finally, if you love space and astronomy, 2018 will be an exciting year.\nNASA has announced plans to send spacecraft to Mars and the sun. Japanese and American probes are set to enter orbit around two asteroids. And a variety of eclipses and meteor showers offer ample opportunities for skygazing. Above, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket launch last month.\nSign up here for reminders about those events, and many more, using our Space and Astronomy Calendar.\nHave a great night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?
