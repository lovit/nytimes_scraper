There, north across the seas from the Russian mainland, men break through the hardened soil looking for mammoth tusks, the subject of a lucrative trade.\nFrom the outset, the movie tells two stories in parallel — one about the mammoth hunters, the other about scientific advances that, with some imagination, raise the prospect of bringing mammoths back. Tagging along with the tusk hunters, Maxim Arbugaev, who is credited as the co-director and cinematographer for the New Siberian Islands footage, effectively becomes part of their team as they search for intact tusks. The hunters, despite risking their lives, barely share in the down-market proceeds. They are part of an unsustainable supply chain that will itself eventually go the way of the mammoth.\nAcross the globe, Frei, a more gratuitous on-camera presence, is first seen in Boston attending a convention where scientists and students hope to make advances in the developing field of synthetic biology. The discipline, in theory, has the potential to take control of the course of evolution.\nThe two threads converge through the movie’s focus on two brothers, who themselves have something of a symbiotic relationship. Peter Grigoriev hunts for mammoth tusks. The more educated Semyon Grigoriev runs a mammoth museum in Yakutsk. And when a mammoth carcass — well preserved enough to bleed — is discovered, Semyon sets about trying to have the animal cloned.\nHe finds the apparent man for the job in Hwang Woo-suk in South Korea, who talks up his success with dog cloning. He and his employees begin dissecting the mammoth chunks. (Comically, we see a sample being stored in an incubator labeled “MAMMOTH,” as if it were just one more animal at the cloning lab.)\nHwang also brings Semyon along for a visit to B.G.I., an institute in China devoted to genome sequencing — turning life into big data, in the movie’s words.\nOnly belatedly does “Genesis 2.0” get around to acknowledging that Hwang was involved in a scandal for fraudulent research practices, a revelation that punctures his credibility and also the film’s — although the rug-pulling may be a key to understanding what Frei is up to.\nIn a sense, the movie is a portrait of multiple sets of foolhardy expeditioners, scientists who dream of doing the impossible and hunters who search for mammoth remains despite a longstanding superstition that finding them will bring bad luck. (One of the hunters, Spira, is portrayed as increasingly succumbing to desperation and perhaps madness.)\nWhile the sights and sounds here are unique, the movie seems frustratingly torn about whether to buy the futurism and mysticism it’s selling. An omnipresent score by Max Richter and Edward Artemyev oversells the wonder factor. By the end, one of the few things that seems certain is that nearly everyone who comes into contact with the raw mammoth material appears remarkably indelicate with it. That’s a rare find — handle with care! And for God’s sake, don’t eat it."
