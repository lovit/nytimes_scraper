As forecast, the “bomb cyclone” paralyzed much of the East Coast as it moved north from Florida.\nWhite-out conditions, school closings and flight cancellations proliferated. Icy waters flooded into downtown Boston, and officials in North Carolina linked three deaths to the storm. Temperatures are set to drop to dangerous lows. Here’s the latest.\nWhat exactly is a “bomb cyclone”? This video explains why it’s not really as scary as it sounds. And we’d love to see your photos and videos of the snow. Above, a scene in Central Park.\n_____\n2. Lawyers for President Trump demanded that Michael Wolff and his publisher halt the release of “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” and apologize or face a possible lawsuit.\nThe book, which is scheduled to be released next week, includes many derogatory remarks by Stephen Bannon, above, about the Trump family. Here’s the letter from Mr. Trump’s lawyer.\n_____\n3. The Trump administration announced several far-reaching measures. One will allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all U.S. waters, inviting the energy industry into more than 100 million acres. A number of states are expected to challenge the plan to protect their coastlines.\nThe Justice Department is strengthening enforcement of federal marijuana laws, potentially undermining legalization in six states, most recently California. Our reporters are helping to deal with the new confusion over marijuana laws. Submit your questions here.\nAnd the U.S. is suspending nearly all security aid to Pakistan, in frustration over Pakistan’s failure to confront terrorist networks within its borders.\n_____\n4. And President Trump spoke with his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in. The two leaders agreed to postpone joint military exercises until after next month’s Winter Olympics. Above, mascots in Seoul.\nSouth Korea is planning talks with the North next week, and North Korean athletes may participate in the games. But our Seoul correspondent reports that there’s deep skepticism of North Korea’s sudden overtures in South Korea, as well as in Washington.\n_____\n5. An alarming sign in Puerto Rico, after months without basic public services in the wake of Hurricane Maria: The island’s only suicide prevention hotline is extremely busy.\nIn this mini-documentary, our reporter Caitlin Dickerson speaks with the counselors who are fielding the calls.\n_____\n6. Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world’s mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in cloud networks.\nBut there is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability — so far. The advice for users is longstanding: Update your software.\n_____\n7. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City is instituting a $25 admission fee for out-of-towners as of March 1.\nThe museum is the world’s largest cultural institution, and the only one in its class without a mandatory entrance fee. But it’s been struggling financially, and the city’s support is slated to decrease soon.\nOur chief art critics say it’s a mistake: “You should be able to walk in off the street and see the art just as you can enter a public library and read the books on the shelf.”\n_____\n8. In the U.S., the fastest growing jobs are mostly done by women, while a quarter of men aren’t working.\nBut one growing field — nursing — has been attracting more men. We talked to some male nurses about why they chose the profession. Many came to it later in life, and say it’s both challenging and fulfilling. “Forget about the stigma,” said Jorge Gitler, an oncology nurse manager, above.\n_____\n9. We talked to Lena Waithe about her new Showtime drama, “The Chi,” chronicling the lives of young men in the South Side of Chicago, her hometown. It debuts Jan. 7.\nThe 33-year-old is a rising star. She became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy series writing, for an episode of “Master of None.”\n“I’m proud to carry that torch and be like ‘I’m gay! I’m black!” she said, expanding on the themes of her impassioned acceptance speech. “Hang your dreams on me. Hang your hopes on me. I’ll carry them to the best of my ability.’”\n_____\n10. Finally, Jimmy Kimmel riffed on the news that Mitt Romney is considering a bid to replace Orrin Hatch as Utah’s senator.\n“If elected, he promises to bring some much-needed boringness back to the Republican Party. I like to imagine Mitt Romney gearing up for a Senate run, furiously ironing his Dockers while ‘Eye of the Tiger’ blasts out of his Amazon Echo.”\nAnd if you’re stuck inside, here’s our updated guide to What to Watch on a Snow Day. Above, a scene from the British series “Chewing Gum.”\nHave a great night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don’t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\nWant to catch up on past briefings?
