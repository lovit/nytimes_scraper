If his defection is confirmed, he would be the highest-ranking defector since Kim Jong-un became leader in 2011. In 2016, the No. 2 diplomat in Britain, Thae Yong-ho, defected to South Korea, expressing disillusionment with Mr. Kim’s government.\nAccording to Kim Min-ki, a lawmaker in the party of President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Cho and his wife fled the North Korean Embassy and residence in Rome and have been in hiding since early November, about a month before his term there was due to end.\nMr. Kim, who leads the intelligence committee in the South Korean Parliament, spoke to reporters in Seoul on Thursday after a closed-door briefing by intelligence officials. He said that he did not know if the acting ambassador remained in Italy or fled elsewhere, and that the intelligence officials had not offered a motive for the disappearance.\nMr. Cho, who was among four North Korean diplomats posted in Italy, has not made contact with South Korean intelligence services since going into hiding, Mr. Kim said, adding that he was not briefed on the whereabouts of Mr. Cho’s two children.\nThe Italian Foreign Ministry said there was no evidence that Mr. Cho had asked for asylum in Italy.\nBefore becoming acting ambassador, Mr. Cho had been promoted in May 2015 from a more junior position in the Rome embassy. He was appointed acting ambassador after Italy expelled the previous envoy in protest of the North’s missile tests."
